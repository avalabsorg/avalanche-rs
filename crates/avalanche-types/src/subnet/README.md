# The Rust VM SDK

The Rust SDK provides a series of abstractions for building Avalanche VMs in pure Rust. Modules for consensus, gossip, and all JSON-RPC endpoints are provided.

The following VMs were built with the SDK:
* Simple Rust VM: [TimestampVM](https://github.com/ava-labs/timestampvm-rs)
* Complex Rust VM: [SpacesVM](https://github.com/ava-labs/spacesvm-rs)

See [this walkthrough guide](https://docs.avax.network/build/vm/create/rust-vm) for detailed information on how to use the SDK to build an Avalanche VM.

If you are interested in contributing to the SDK, or have a question, please open a [Github Issue](https://github.com/ava-labs/avalanche-rs/issues/new) to discuss.
